# LaTeX with TikZ Paper Compilation Project

This repository is designed to help you compile and produce academic papers written in LaTeX, with a focus on leveraging TikZ for high-quality diagrams and illustrations.

## Features

- **Modular Structure:** The project is organized into sections (e.g., introduction, methodology, results) for easy editing and collaboration.
- **TikZ Integration:** Includes several example figures and diagrams created using TikZ, demonstrating how to visually represent concepts such as Petri Nets and wiring diagrams.
- **IEEEtran Template:** Uses the IEEEtran document class for professional formatting, suitable for conference and journal submissions.
- **Automated Build:** A `Makefile` is provided to automate the compilation process, including bibliography generation.
- **Clean Version Control:** The `.gitignore` file is tailored for LaTeX projects, ensuring that build artifacts and sensitive author information are not tracked.

## Getting Started

1. **Install LaTeX:** Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
2. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd LaTeX_with_TikZ
   ```
3. **Edit Author Information:**  
   Update `.author_info.tex` with your details, or use `author_info.example.tex` as a template.
4. **Compile the Paper:**  
   Use the provided `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will generate `main.pdf` with all sections and figures included.

## Project Structure

- `main.tex` — Main entry point, includes all sections and figures.
- `sections/` — Contains the main content sections (introduction, methodology, results, etc.).
- `figures/` — TikZ source files for diagrams and illustrations.
- `.author_info.tex` — Author information (excluded from version control).
- `Makefile` — Automates the build process.
- `.gitignore` — Excludes LaTeX build artifacts and sensitive files.

## Customization

- Add or modify sections in the `sections/` directory.
- Create new TikZ figures in the `figures/` directory and include them in your sections.
- Adjust the bibliography as needed for your references.
