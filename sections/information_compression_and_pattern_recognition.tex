GASing represents a fundamental form of information compression that begins at the representational level:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pattern-Specific Optimizations}: By identifying and exploiting digit patterns (repeating digits, special sequences), GASing achieves a form of numerical "semantic compression" analogous to how attention mechanisms learn to focus on relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones.
\item \textbf{Compositional Understanding}: GASing parses numbers as compositional entities with internal structure, much like how Transformers understand sentences as structured sequences. This allows arithmetic operations to leverage the compositional nature of numerical representation itself.
\item \textbf{Adaptive Processing Depth}: For simple patterns, GASing can use shallow processing (direct lookup); for complex patterns, it can apply deeper, recursive processingâ€”parallel to how Transformer layers process simple and complex linguistic patterns with varying attention distributions.
\end{itemize}
