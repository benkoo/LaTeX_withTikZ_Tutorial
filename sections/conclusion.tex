\sectionheader{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced a new perspective on Petri Nets, showing how tensor algebra and polynomial functors can be used to model topologically structured, compositional computations. The Tensorized Petri Net formalism unifies symbolic and neural approaches, enabling efficient, interpretable, and modular computation. Future work will explore applications to neural-symbolic integration, automated reasoning, and the design of new computational architectures for arithmetic and beyond.

In this paper, we presented a Petri Net model for [specific system or process]. Our model successfully captures [specific aspects or properties] and provides insights into [specific findings]. The analysis of the model demonstrates [specific results or implications].
