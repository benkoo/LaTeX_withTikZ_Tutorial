\subsection{Tensorized Petri Nets via Polynomial Functors}

\subsubsection{Tensor Representation of Petri Nets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Places as Tensor Indices:} Each place in a Petri Net corresponds to an index in a tensor, representing a position (e.g., a digit in a number, or a cell in a grid).
    \item \textbf{Tokens as Tensor Entries:} The state of the net is encoded as a tensor, with entries indicating the presence or value of tokens at each place.
    \item \textbf{Transitions as Tensor Operations:} Transitions correspond to multilinear maps or contractions, updating the tensor state according to the netâ€™s rules.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Polynomial Functors for Compositionality}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Elements as Operators and Operands:} Inspired by polynomial functors, each element (place or transition) can act as both an operand (receiving tokens) and an operator (transforming tokens).
    \item \textbf{Functorial Structure:} The wiring of the Petri Net encodes a functorial mapping from input tensors (operands) to output tensors (results), supporting modular and hierarchical composition.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example: Digit-wise Arithmetic}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Digit Positions as Places:} Each digit position in a number is a place in the Petri Net.
    \item \textbf{Carry and Sum as Transitions:} Transitions implement digit-wise addition, carry propagation, and modular reduction, all as tensor operations.
    \item \textbf{Topological Relationships:} The tensor structure captures the adjacency of digits and the flow of carries, enabling parallel and interpretable computation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Definition}

[Define the specific problem you are addressing with your Petri Net model]

\subsection{Proposed Petri Net Model}

Our proposed Petri Net model for [specific system or process] consists of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Places}: Represent [specific states or conditions in your system]
    \item \textbf{Transitions}: Represent [specific events or actions in your system]
    \item \textbf{Tokens}: Represent [specific resources or entities in your system]
\end{itemize}

To illustrate common concurrency problems that can be modeled with Petri Nets, we present the Dining Philosophers problem (Figure \ref{fig:dining_philosophers}) and the Producer-Consumer problem (Figure \ref{fig:producer_consumer_workflow}).

\subsection{Model Analysis}

To analyze the properties of our Petri Net model, we examine:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reachability}: Determining whether a specific marking can be reached from the initial marking.
    \item \textbf{Boundedness}: Ensuring that the number of tokens in each place does not exceed a finite bound.
    \item \textbf{Liveness}: Verifying that the model is free from deadlocks.
    \item \textbf{Fairness}: Ensuring that all enabled transitions eventually fire.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wiring Diagram Representation}

Figure \ref{fig:clock_with_display} presents a wiring diagram in the style of David Jaz Myers' work on Dynamical Systems, illustrating the structure of a clock system with display components.
