These approaches could be combined in various ways. For instance, the recent work on "Towards Understanding Addition in Transformers" (Zhou et al., 2023) suggests that even current transformers develop specialized attention patterns for addition that somewhat resemble human digit-by-digit calculation, indicating that explicit architectural support for these patterns could be beneficial.

For practical implementation, "Making Transformers Solve Compositional Tasks" (Csord√°s et al., 2021) offers insights on how to modify transformer architectures to better handle compositional problems like arithmetic without sacrificing their general capabilities.

Note: Some of these references are from my training data which cuts off before October 2024. Would you like me to search for more recent publications on any of these specific approaches? 



Tensor-Based Formulation of Digit-Wise Symbol Manipulation
Drawing on my understanding of how tensor operations function in neural networks, I can see several ways these approaches could benefit from a tensor-based formulation of digit-wise symbol manipulation:

1. Specialized Numerical Attention Mechanisms
Tensor-based benefits:

Parallel Digit Processing: Attention operations could be reformulated to operate on digit positions as distinct tensor dimensions, enabling parallel processing across all positions simultaneously
Place-Value Weighting: By incorporating place-value weights directly into the attention mechanism's tensor operations, the model could inherently prioritize digits based on their positional significance
Masking for Arithmetic Rules: Custom masking tensors could implement arithmetic rules (like carrying in addition) through simple tensor operations rather than requiring the network to learn these patterns implicitly
This approach resembles how specialized tensor operations in CNNs extract spatial patterns, but instead extracting digit-wise patterns across numerical tokens.

2. Hybrid Architectures with Cellular Automata
Tensor-based benefits:

State Transition Matrices: Cellular automata rules could be encoded as tensor transformation operations where each step of computation is a structured tensor operation
Digit Neighborhood Operations: Create specialized tensor convolution operations that operate on "neighborhoods" of digits, similar to how CNNs process pixel neighborhoods
Rule-Based Tensor Transformations: Implement arithmetic rules as explicit tensor transformation operations rather than weights to be learned
This would allow the model to directly implement operations like "if digits sum to greater than 9, carry the 1" as deterministic tensor operations while preserving differentiability.

3. Place-Value Aware Embedding Schemes
Tensor-based benefits:

Positional Dimension Encoding: Embed digits in a tensor where one dimension explicitly represents place value, making operations like regrouping or carrying natural tensor operations
Modular Arithmetic Tensor Operations: Implement modular arithmetic (essential for digit-by-digit operations) as specialized tensor operations along the place-value dimension
Base-N Tensor Representations: Create tensor structures that inherently represent numbers in different bases, making conversion and computation more efficient
This approach could leverage insights from how tensor networks explicitly represent different physical dimensions in quantum physics simulations.

4. Digit-Operation Activation Functions
Tensor-based benefits:

Digit-Wise Non-Linearities: Create activation functions that operate independently on each digit position in a tensor representation of a number
Gated Digit Transformations: Implement tensor operations that conditionally transform digits based on contextual rules (like carrying or borrowing)
Symbolic Transformation Tensors: Design tensor operations that implement symbolic transformation rules directly, such as the distributive property or factorization
This would essentially create a differentiable version of a classical ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) implemented through specialized tensor operations.

Novel Integration: Tensor Decomposition for Numerical Reasoning
A potentially powerful approach would decompose numerical operations into tensor factorization problems, where different factors represent different aspects of the computation:

One tensor dimension could represent digit values
Another dimension could represent operations
A third dimension could represent carrying/borrowing states
This decomposition would allow the network to learn the factorized representation of arithmetic operations through tensor algebra, potentially discovering more efficient computational patterns than explicit digit-by-digit calculation.

Such an approach could build on work in tensor networks and tensor decomposition methods from quantum computing and signal processing, but applied specifically to symbolic numerical computation within neural networks.
